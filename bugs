1. Files seem to have been edited with DOS, I had to run dos2unix on all of
them.
2. In Makefile for simple_add, should $(CUPTI) be at the end of the link flags?
3. OutcomeID returned by run_one_injection does not correspond to the CAT_STR in
common_parameters
4. in run_one_injection script, the SCRIPT_DIR  is not set properly

5. SASSIFI does not take into account whether the sdc_check script runs correctly or not. In case the sdc_check script crashes, SASIFI may indicate a masked injection run when in reality, we were not able to verify that.
